# The Farmers Market Locator

### Introduction

 The locator application was thought out for my drive to help get fresh vegetables and produce and support my local community. I would here of people going to them and often wondered where they were and when i would move would have to search hard to find the one that i would be near and/or for my new area.

 This App allows for the user do do just that. If you find your self moving or visiting a new location rather then head wrenching work to find that local farmers market for the area. you can now just put in zip code and get back a list of near by farmers markets and a link to google maps to get you there. Enjoy your fresh produce and support your local farmers!!
